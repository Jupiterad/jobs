*Framework agnostic development

*Application architecture
*Version control
*Relational and non-relational databases and when to use them

*Django, Flask, Sqlalchemy
*PostgreSQL, ElasticSearch, MySQL
*Redis, Varnish, RabbitMQ, Celery

*Facilitate technical decision making in the teams
*Help with hiring including interviewing
*Work on improving development process, policy and general team needs
*Engage in regular one to ones with each team member
*Work closely with the Agile Coach

*Competitive salary
*24 days holiday, plus bank holidays
